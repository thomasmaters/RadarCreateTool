# ANoniem's - Radar Create Tool
Create custom radar images for MTA maps like DM's and DD's. This tool will generate radar-'tiles' or one complete image. These can be externaly edited to the users preferences.


## Example generated radar (not photoshopped):
This radar consists of a 10 by 10 grid made of 512px by 512px, stitched together and outputted as one image. The generation of this image took around 1.5 minutes, but this will be inproved in upcomming commits.
