# A.Noniem's - Radar Create Tool
Create custom radar images for MTA maps like DM's and DD's. This tool will generate radar-'tiles' or one complete image. These can be externaly edited to the users preferences.


## Example generated radar (not photoshopped):
This radar is made using a custom DM map (A.Noniem Vol.2 - Boombastic) and consists of a 10 by 29 grid made of 512px by 512px, stiched together and outputted as one image. The generation of this radar took around 4.5 minutes and is the first radar image created using a DM.
